# Week 1 - Module 1 Challenge

This week we regenerated our code according to HTML Semantic Elements.

## What are Semantic Elements?

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: div and span - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: header, footer, and article - Clearly defines its content.
